# The Gps Speedometer
# The purpose
I'm visually impaired and as so it's really anoying when I'm on the freeway and I can't see the speedometer. So I decided to create this app to, somewhat accurately, tell me how fast I'm going. I also spent some time to make it look cool :)
I might add some more functionality to it in the future.
I created the project using Expo and React Native because these are the tools I'm most familiar with for mobile development.

## Description
This is a simple speedometer app that uses the GPS sensor to calculate the speed of the device. It also shows the current location of the device in terms of latitude and longitude. The app displays the speed in big and bold text and also has a react-native-cool-speedometer :) 
You can configure the speed unit and the font size of the speed text.
FOCUS MODE: 
The app has a focus mode that will make the speed text bigger. This is useful when you want to use the app while driving. You can enable the focus mode by pressing the focus button anywhere on the screen.
